//short code is ideal in competitive programming because programs should be written as fast as possible, teivayera programmers often define shorter names for datatypes and other part of codee, kina vane the code we write in cp doesnot require maintenance or readability, the only thing that matters is how fast and efficiently you can solve a particular problemmmm????


//typedef: give shorter names to datatypes...

typedef long long ll;

int main () {
// long long a = 12342354; can be shortened to ...
ll a = 25346626;
cout << a*a << endl;
return 0;
}

//similarlyy 
// typedef vector<int> vi;
// typedef pair<int, int> pi;
