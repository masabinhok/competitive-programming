//timecomplexity is basically a function to calculate the efficiency of an algorithm, estimates how much time the alogrithm will take to run.


//Calculation Rules
//it is denoted by O(...), where ... is the function of n, where n is the input size. array: size of array hunxa ani string vayo vane length of stringgg...


//Loops
//Loop is the main reason why the algorithm is slow, the more nested loop the algorithm contains, the slower it iss... 
//if there are k loops then the time complexity is O(n^k), where n is the input size.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


int main (){
//time complexity of this code is O(10^2) as there are two nested loops.
for(int i =1 ; i<=10; i++){
  for(int j=1; j<=10; j++){
  printf("Hello World\n");
  }
}
}
